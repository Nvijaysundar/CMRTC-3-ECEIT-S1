During the state elections, a team is tasked with validating the turnout of citizens using their unique voter ID numbers. 
The IDs were collected digitally from multiple booths across the city and merged into one dataset.
A specific citizen claims to have voted multiple times due to a technical error. To verify this claim, the team needs to count how many times this citizen's voter ID appears in the list.
Can you assist the election team in verifying this claim by counting the occurrences of a given voter ID?
 Input Format:
•	First line: Integer n (number of entries)
