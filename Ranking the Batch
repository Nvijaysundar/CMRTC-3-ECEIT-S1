The school administration has gathered final exam marks for a batch of students. Unfortunately, due to a system migration, the marks are currently stored in an unsorted list. 
Before announcing the toppers and organizing the convocation ceremony, the administration wants to publish an official rank list from the lowest to the highest score.
To maintain transparency and fairness, every student's name will appear on the rank list in sorted order of their marks. 
You’ve been given the responsibility of helping the administration arrange the marks correctly.
