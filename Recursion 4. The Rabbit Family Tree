Long ago, a farmer kept rabbits in his barn and noticed something unusual about how they reproduced. 
Each new pair of rabbits took one month to grow up, and from the second month onwards, each pair produced another pair every month. 
The farmer became curious to know how many pairs of rabbits he would have in a given month if this pattern continued. 
His son decided to write a small program to calculate the number of rabbit pairs in the Nth month. 
The villagers called this the “family tree of rabbits,” as it kept growing endlessly. 
The farmer uses this number to plan how much food he must store in advance. Everyone in the village started asking him about the rabbit family tree for different months.
