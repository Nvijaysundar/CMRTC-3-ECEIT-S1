 
An online grocery warehouse updates its stock prices daily. The warehouse manager suspects the update script might be introducing inconsistencies. To ensure everything is running smoothly,
you are given a snapshot of the current prices for a specific category of products.
You need to examine whether the price list was updated in the correct order. If any price is lower than the one before it, the update process must have malfunctioned.
Help the manager by verifying the sequence of prices.
