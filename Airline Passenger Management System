An airline stores passenger details in a system for a single flight. Each passenger's data is stored in the format:

Name,Age,SeatNumber,Destination,TicketPrice

Example:
John Doe,32,15A,London,5500

Your task is to create a Java program that:

1. Data Input

* Accept N passenger records as strings from the user and store them in a String array.

2. String Operations

* Clean: Remove extra spaces around commas and words (trim + replaceAll).
* Split: Use split(",") to separate Name, Age, Seat, Destination, TicketPrice.
* Format Names: Convert passenger names to Title Case.
* Find:

  * Passengers going to a specific destination (case-insensitive).
  * Passengers whose names start with a certain letter.
  * Passengers above a certain age.

3. Array Operations

* Store only names in a separate array for alphabetical sorting.
* Sort passengers by name and display them in order.
* Reverse the sorted array.
* Search for a passenger by name and return their seat number.
* Count total passengers per destination.

4. Mathematical Operations

* Calculate the average age of all passengers.
* Calculate the total ticket revenue for the flight.
* Find the highest and lowest ticket price.
* Calculate the percentage of passengers traveling to a specific destination.

Example Input:
Enter number of passengers: 5
Enter passenger details:
john doe , 32 , 15A , London , 5500
ALICE SMITH, 28, 10B, New York, 7200
michael jordan , 45 , 1A , London , 6800
robert brown, 36, 3C, Paris , 4500
anna bell, 29, 14B, New York , 7000

Enter destination to filter: London
Enter starting letter for names: A
Enter minimum age: 30
Enter name to search seat: Alice Smith

Example Output:
Formatted Passenger List:
John Doe, 32, 15A, London, 5500
Alice Smith, 28, 10B, New York, 7200
Michael Jordan, 45, 1A, London, 6800
Robert Brown, 36, 3C, Paris, 4500
Anna Bell, 29, 14B, New York, 7000

Passengers going to 'London':
John Doe
Michael Jordan

Passengers starting with 'A':
Alice Smith
Anna Bell

Passengers above age 30:
John Doe
Michael Jordan
Robert Brown

Sorted Passenger Names:
Alice Smith
Anna Bell
John Doe
Michael Jordan
Robert Brown

Reversed Sorted Passenger Names:
Robert Brown
Michael Jordan
John Doe
