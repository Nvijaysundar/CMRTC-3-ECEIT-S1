Scenario: Bus Fare Management System

A travel company wants to create a basic system to manage fare collections and passenger records for its daily city buses.

Each bus can carry a maximum of 50 passengers. For every passenger, the fare is calculated based on the distance they travel. The fare rate is ₹5 per kilometer.

You are required to design a Java program to handle the following:

1. Create a class Passenger with the following:

    Instance variables: name, pickupPoint, dropPoint, distance, fare
    distance and fare are calculated based on pickup and drop points
    Use a method to accept passenger details using the Scanner class
    Use a method to calculate the distance and fare (distance = dropPoint - pickupPoint, fare = distance * 5)
    Use a method to return/display passenger details

2. Maintain a static variable in the Passenger class:

    totalFareCollected – to store the total fare collected from all passengers
    It should update every time a new passenger's fare is calculated

3. In the main class:

    Create an array of 50 Passenger objects (or less based on user input)
    Allow the user to enter how many passengers are boarding (limit: 50)
    For each passenger, input name, pickup point (1 to 10), and drop point (greater than pickup)
    After processing all passengers:

      Display each passenger's details
      Display the total fare collected
      Display the passenger who paid the maximum fare

Constraints:

 Pickup and drop points are integers from 1 to 10
 Distance = dropPoint - pickupPoint
 Fare = distance × ₹5
 

Sample I/p and Output
Enter number of passengers (max 50): 3

Enter details for Passenger 1
Name: Ramesh
Pickup Point (1-10): 3
Drop Point (must be > 3): 7

Enter details for Passenger 2
Name: Sita
Pickup Point (1-10): 2
Drop Point (must be > 2): 5

Enter details for Passenger 3
Name: John
Pickup Point (1-10): 1
Drop Point (must be > 1): 10

Passenger Details:
------------------
Name: Ramesh
Pickup: 3, Drop: 7
Distance: 4 km
Fare: ₹20

Name: Sita
Pickup: 2, Drop: 5
Distance: 3 km
Fare: ₹15

Name: John
Pickup: 1, Drop: 10
Distance: 9 km
Fare: ₹45

------------------
Total Fare Collected: ₹80
Passenger who paid the maximum fare: John (₹45)
