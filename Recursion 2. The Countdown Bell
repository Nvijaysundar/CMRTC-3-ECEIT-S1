Every evening in the old village temple, a bell is rung before the evening prayers begin. 
The bell rings in a countdown fashion, starting from a large number chosen by the priest and going down to one. 
This countdown echoes through the valley, and villagers wait eagerly to hear it before lighting their lamps. 
Sometimes the priest forgets to strike the bell, so the temple caretaker thought of using a small program to perform the task. 
The program should accept the starting number and ring out every number until one. If the number is not valid, the program must indicate that no countdown is possible. 
The caretaker wants this to be reliable since the prayers cannot begin without it.
